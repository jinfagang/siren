## Bluemap

First of all, I need a broker, but the question is many broker implement on not quit good languages, such as C++, I need broker to tell my intelligent brain like Jarvis what he got from all devices. But Jarivs built on Python, if he should got the messages, then the broker should either a python program or must be able to communicated with broker.

I just blink a thought, we can do somethings like this: using out of box borker to provid the simple MQTT broker function, and let Jarvis to subscribe all the messages in my universe. So he will able to got exactly all messages from other devices. And he can analysis on those messages too!!!!!!!!!!

Ok, I will keep on doing this, see you soon.......
